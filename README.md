### Current Projects

#### Project: Automated Data Scraping from Weather Website and storage to a local database

##### Introduction

In a world increasingly reliant on data-driven decision-making, access to accurate and up-to-date weather information is crucial for various applications, from agriculture to logistics and personal planning. This project aims to hone my skills in data scraping data from a website. This data will be in an unstructured state so data cleaning and transformation skills will also be required. This process of will retrieve, clean and transform the data automatically and then store it in a local database for easy access and analysis.

##### Project Overview

**Objective**: The primary goal of this project is to automate the retrieval of weather data from a selected weather website and establish a local database to store this data efficiently.

**Key Components**:

1. **Web Scraping**: We will develop a web scraping script using the BeautiSoup library to extract the weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions) from the weather website. This script will run at specified intervals to keep the data up to date.

2. **Data Transformation**: Once the data is scraped, it will be transformed and structured into a format suitable for database storage. This step may involve data cleaning and formatting.

3. **Local Database**: We will set up a local database using SQLite to store the scraped weather data. The database schema will be designed to accommodate the specific data attributes.

4. **Automation**: The entire process will be automated, with scheduled runs of the web scraping script to keep the database updated with the latest weather information.

5. **Data Access**: Users will be able to access and query the local database for weather information.

**Benefits**:

- **Data Availability**: Weather data will be readily available in a local database, reducing the need for real-time API calls to external sources.

- **Data Analysis**: With data stored locally, I intend to use this data in future projects.

#### Project: Webpage with Weather Chatbot using Local Database

## Introduction

In an era where technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, having a chatbot that can provide weather forecasts in a conversational manner can be a valuable asset. This project aims to develop my skills with the creation of chatbots and builds off the project above. The chatbot will retrieve weather data from a local database and respond in a human-like text format.

### Project Overview

**Objective**: The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based chatbot that can provide weather forecasts based on user queries and data stored in a local database.

**Key Components**:

1. **User Interface**: A web page will be created to serve as the user interface. Users can input their queries about the weather through a prompt or chatbox.

2. **Chatbot Development**: The chatbot will be designed to understand natural language queries related to weather forecasts. It will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and interpret user inputs.

3. **Local Database Integration**: Weather data, previously collected from a weather website and stored in a local database as part of a previous project, will be used by the chatbot to provide responses. The chatbot will query the database to retrieve weather forecasts for specific dates.

4. **Conversational Responses**: The chatbot will respond to user queries in a conversational and human-like manner. Responses will include weather conditions, temperatures, and any other relevant information for the specified date.

5. **Web Interaction**: Users will interact with the chatbot through the web page, where they can ask questions like, "What will the weather be like on [specific date]?" The chatbot will generate informative and user-friendly responses.

**Benefits**:

- **User-Friendly Access**: The web-based chatbot provides an easy and intuitive way for users to inquire about weather forecasts without needing to navigate complex interfaces or APIs.

- **Conversational Experience**: Users can have a natural conversation with the chatbot, making the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

- **Data Utilization**: The project leverages previously collected weather data, making efficient use of data already available in the local database.

- **Integration Potential**: The chatbot can be further expanded and integrated into other platforms or applications to provide weather information seamlessly.

By creating a chatbot with access to a local weather database, this project enhances the accessibility and usability of weather information for users in a conversational manner.
